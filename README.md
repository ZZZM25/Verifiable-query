# Verifiable-query

VGQ provides verifiable graph queries for blockchain systems. 

When executing the above code, a graph database needs to be installed on the server side. 

For conducting comparative experiments with QRD, a relational database needs to be installed on the server side. 

Both querying and verification are performed locally at the application layer.

The version of the graph database is Neo4j (community-4.4.30), and the version of the relational database is 8.4.3.
